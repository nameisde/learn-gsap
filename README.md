This is my personal repository for learning GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform), a highly powerful JavaScript animation library. Here, I will be experimenting with various animation concepts and techniques offered by GSAP. 

This repository serves as a space for experimentation, tracking progress, and developing my understanding of GSAP.
